<h2>You probably have some questions...</h2>
<p><span class="question">Can the receiver of the message reply?</span></p>
<blockquote class="answer">Yes, but the only personal information exchanged is a license plate number. Phone numbers and names remain anonymous unless you decide otherwise.</blockquote>
<p><span class="question"> Will this platform depend on people texting and driving?</span></p>
<blockquote class="answer">We are strongly against texting and driving. Many injuries have resulted from irresponsible drivers on their phone. Texting and driving is illegal and punishable. We recommend memorizing the license plate number that one wishes to message so that they can pull over at a reasonable time and message that car. We do our best to stay at the cutting end of technology and hope to utilize the ability for devices to read text aloud and speech recognition capabilities to help end the dangerous habit of texting on the road. We are working to create a device in cars that takes away the need for texting at all.</blockquote>
<p><span class="question">What if someone keeps sending me messages and it makes me uncomfortable?</span></p>
<blockquote class="answer">People are only able to send at most two wheeltalks to one license plate. this takes away any ability for someone to herass someone. We would like to keep a tight community of responsible wheeltalkers or want to help other people and make the road a safer and more pleasant place and whenever someone receives a message that makes them uncomfortable or unsafe, they can notify wheeltalks and wheeltalks can take appropriate action.</blockquote>
